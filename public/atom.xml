This park is a popular spot for residents and visitors, offering a place to relax, exercise, and connect with nature.</p><h2 id="Location-and-Area"><a href="#Location-and-Area" class="headerlink" title="Location and Area"></a>Location and Area</h2><p>S2 city Park is a 1.5 mile (3,500-step) route located near Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. This route has an elevation gain of about 114.8 ft and is rated as easy.</p><h2 id="Improvements"><a href="#Improvements" class="headerlink" title="Improvements"></a>Improvements</h2><p>Recognizing its importance, IJM Land has invested RM 1 million to upgrade and enhance City Park. The renovations aim to restore the park’s charm and improve facilities for everyone, especially families with young children. New playground equipment, including swings and playful animal riders, will ensure that kids have a safe and fun place to play.</p><p>In addition to the physical upgrades, the park will also feature colorful art installations to make it even more inviting.
