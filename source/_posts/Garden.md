# S2 City Park

## Introduction
City Park in Seremban 2 is a beloved green space that has served the community for over 20 years. Opened in 2005, it spans 15 acres and features a beautiful lake, jogging tracks, exercise stations, and playgrounds. This park is a popular spot for residents and visitors, offering a place to relax, exercise, and connect with nature.

## Location and Area 
S2 city Park is a 1.5 mile (3,500-step) route located near Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. This route has an elevation gain of about 114.8 ft and is rated as easy.

## Improvements
Recognizing its importance, IJM Land has invested RM 1 million to upgrade and enhance City Park. The renovations aim to restore the park's charm and improve facilities for everyone, especially families with young children. New playground equipment, including swings and playful animal riders, will ensure that kids have a safe and fun place to play.

In addition to the physical upgrades, the park will also feature colorful art installations to make it even more inviting. Local artist Elmer Leong is creating eye-catching backdrops and murals that celebrate creativity and nature. One of the exciting new additions is "Tapir Corner," which promotes awareness of endangered tapir species. These improvements will make City Park a vibrant hub for the community, where residents can enjoy outdoor activities and create lasting memories together.
